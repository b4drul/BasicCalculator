# Basic Calculator

Welcome to my Basic Calculator repository! This project is a simple calculator built using Android Studio. It serves as a learning tool to teach students about XML layout design, Java structure in Android Studio, linking components, and the logic behind creating a calculator with interaction between the front-end (XML) and back-end (Java).


## Repository Contents
1. **XML Layout:** Explore the XML files that define the user interface of the calculator. Understand how the different components such as buttons, text fields, and layouts are organized and styled.

2. **Java Logic:** Dive into the Java code that implements the functionality of the calculator. Analyze how user input is captured, processed, and displayed on the calculator's interface.

3. **Linking XML and Java:** Understand how XML and Java files are linked in Android Studio. Learn about the methods used to handle user interactions and update the UI based on the calculated results.


## How to Use this Repository
To make the most out of this repository, follow these steps:

1. **Explore the XML Layout:** Review the XML files that define the calculator's user interface. Understand the structure, layout, and styling applied to different components.

2. **Review the Java Logic:** Dive into the Java code that implements the calculator's functionality. Understand how user input is processed, mathematical operations are performed, and results are displayed.

3. **Run the Application:** Build and run the application in Android Studio's emulator or on a physical device. Interact with the calculator to test its functionality and verify the expected behavior.
